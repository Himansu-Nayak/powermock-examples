PowerMock is an open source mocking library for the Java world. 
It extends the existing mocking frameworks, such as[EasyMock](http://www.easymock.org/) and [Mockito](http://code.google.com/p/mockito/), 
to add even more powerful features to them. PowerMock enables us to write good unit tests for even the most untestable code. 
Most of the mocking frameworks in Java cannot mock static methods or final classes. But using PowerMock, we can mock almost any class.
